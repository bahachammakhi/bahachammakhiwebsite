In this post, I am gonna talk mainly about code quality the main task was to add some features to the project but suddenly I found my self blocked because of the poor spaghetti code written by the devs before me, the solution was refactoring and repeating a big part of the application.

Things I learned :

- Code quality is a priority in creating products👨🏻‍💻

- Make your code readable and easy to understand by refactoring.

- Follow pattern designs it will make your code better.

- A bad code quality feels like he’ll for a developer so please don’t ship a bad code.🥵
